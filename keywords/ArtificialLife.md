## Artifical Life
When discussing artificial life (ALife), many people often confuse it with artificial intelligence (AI). 
While the two fields are closely related, they are fundamentally distinct areas of study. The study of artificial 
life is a scientific exploration of the fundamentals of life and the construction of “living systems” through hardware
or software. In contrast, artificial intelligence focuses on mimicking intelligent behavior, such as learning, reasoning, 
and decision-making, to perform tasks that typically require human cognition.[^Gardient19Intro]

The foundation of ALife was first formally introduced in 1987 by computer scientist Christopher Langton at the first workshop
on artificial life in New Mexico. He defined artificial life as “life made by man rather than by nature.” [^Korb09ALife]
The goal of ALife is not merely to mimic biological life but to understand the broader possibilities of lifelike processes 
in any form. Today, artificial life can be classified into three main categories: Hard Artificial Life, Soft Artificial Life,
and Wet Artificial Life. For a quick summary: 

•	Hard Artificial Life refers to artificial life realized as computer hardware 
or machines, such as self-replicating robots or autonomous systems.

•	Soft Artificial Life refers to artificial life realized as computer software, such as simulations 
of evolving digital organisms in virtual environments.

•	Wet Artificial Life refers to artificial life realized biochemically, such as synthetic cells
or DNA-based systems created in laboratories.

While conducting research on artificial life, I have developed concerns about how this technology may impact our lives. We
now live in a fast-paced world where new technologies are consistently being released. New media has become an integral part
of our lives, turning a significant portion of our daily activities into highly connected digital experiences. Artificial life
can easily be linked to domains related to new media, such as virtual reality, avatars, and cybernetics. As a result, we must
remain aware of how this technology may influence our lives, both positively and negatively.

No matter whether it is on a software platform or a hardware platform, artificial life technology is intended to create life,
which will likely entirely change our perception of what life is, based on our current understanding. [^Akama13ALife] For example,
the creation of synthetic organisms or self-evolving digital entities challenges traditional definitions of life and raises
ethical, philosophical, and societal questions. While such powerful technology is emerging, is the current regulatory framework
sufficient to control its development and ensure it does not negatively impact society?
